# Testing

As mentioned in the course everything should be developed from the "Mobile First Approach". Whith this in mind
I searched different websited and sources on how to make the best approach. After developing every page I ran a few tests on different devices and different browsers in order to confirm that all works within the specs and line of codes. 

1. Go to the "Landing" Page
    1. Go to the Landing Page from Google Chrome Web Browser.
    2. Inspect the different device aspect/screeen size ratios.
    3. The Image will remain fixed in the background and you will see the scrolling effect it creates by staying in place. 
    4. Header Title and Button adjusts/reacts to specific min/max screen size.

2. Go to the "About" Page
    1. Go to the "About" Page from Google Chrome Web Browser.
    2. Inspect the different device aspect/screeen size ratios.
    3. Columns Will adjusts/reacts to specific min/max screen size, I decided to maintain a single transition from deviding into 3 columns of devices with a screen size bigger than 900px and  switching to a full width at min width of 900px. The reason for this is that I would like to keep a uniformed look instead of breaking down to 2 columns and a single column beneath. 

3. Go to the "Pricing" Page
    1. Go to the "Pricing" Page from Google Chrome Web Browser.
    2. Inspect the different device aspect/screeen size ratios.
    3. Since this is a bootstrap snippet it reacts smoothly and maintaining a uniformed outline.

4. Go to the "Reviews" Page
    1. Go to the "Reviews" Page from Google Chrome Web Browser.
    2. Inspect the different device aspect/screeen size ratios.
    3. Posted Reviews will adjust to the screen size accordingly maintaining a good size for the overall experience.

5. Go to the "Contact" Page
    1. Go to the "Contact" Page from Google Chrome Web Browser.
    2. Inspect the different device aspect/screeen size ratios.
    3. The "Contact" Page was developed in the footer part of the page with a simple design which is responsive and also active.
    4. Click on the "Mobile" icon in order to place a phone call.
    5. Click on the "Paper Plane" icon in order to send an email.
