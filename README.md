Where you're at work, on the road or at the beach, you can easily view what's in your immediate surrounding.

# Experience 297 | Here, Near and Everywhere!
Experience 297 will forever change the way you and local business Experience Aruba. With our Proximity/Location Based Experience App you will be able to search, view and interact with everything and everyone around you. Our Experience is categorized in Three Flavors:

  - Here 
  - Near 
  - Everywhere 

# Here
  - We Definitely believe that you should be on the Map.

# Near
  - Your overall experience goes beyond your physical location.

# Everywhere
  - We know how dedicated you are on impacting our community.


#### Who, What, When and Why:
 - Who: A spectacular presentation from an innovator and futurist.
 - When: Everything started in August 2018 with a simple yet impactful presentation
 - Why: As I started my Developing Enthousiasm I thought, how can I impact my community?
 - What: Well everything currently is internet & mobile, so why not make Convenience an Experience. And at that moment I thought about a Location Based Experience where I can create experience with everything and/or everyone on the island of Aruba.
